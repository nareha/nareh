# nareh | Terminal
a terminal-style personal website.

this website has plans to finish and deploy soon. thank you for your patience.

### disclaimer
in its current state, this is not the best code implementation for this website. the hope is to continuously update the site as i learn, and even possibly change technologies.

### inspiration credits
while the idea to make a website of this style was a personal one, inspiration for the implementation of this website comes from [Yassine Fathi](https://github.com/m4tt72/terminal). a youtuber i enjoy, [Forrest Knight](https://fkcodes.com/), also referenced Yassine's implementation, and i inevitably drew some inspiration from his implementation as well.
